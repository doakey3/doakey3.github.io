<h1>Gomco Circumcision Template</h1>

The parents were told that circumcision is an elective procedure. The risks and benefits of the procedure were reviewed with the parents. Risks to include bleeding, infection, dissatisfaction with appearance, and injury to the penis. Benefits to include mild reduction in rate of UTI, prevention of phimosis, reduction in already rare occurrence of penile cancer, decreased risk of STI, and easier penile hygiene. The parents were warned that the procedure may need to be stopped early if hypospadia is found. The consent form was signed prior to the procedure.

A timeout was completed before the procedure. The infant was restrained in the supine position. A total of [1] mL of [1]% lidocaine solution without epinephrine was injected at dorsal nerve at the base of the penis. The penis was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The preputial opening was dilated and the foreskin was separated from the glans penis. Scissors were used to create a dorsal slit and the foreskin was completely retracted until the corona was visualized. The bell was then placed over the glans penis. The plate of the clamp was applied at the level of the corona and the clamp tightened. A circumferential incision was made with a cold knife. The clamp was left in place for [5] minutes to allow for clotting and coagulation to occur. The clamp was removed and Vaseline was applied at the crush line with good hemostasis.

The patient's parent was instructed to keep the wound site clean and covered with Vaseline until fully healed. The parent was warned that normal granulation tissue may form on glans penis. The parent was told to watch for signs of infection (redness, pus, swelling) and to return for followup or go to the ER if this occurs.

Nursing was instructed to check for worsening bleeding every 15 minutes after
the procedure x 1 hour.
