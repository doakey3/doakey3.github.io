PROCEDURE:
(For volar cysts) The position of the radial artery was confirmed with ultrasound.

Diagnosis was confirmed by transillumination of the cyst. The procedure--including risk of infection, bleeding, and pain--was explained to the patient. Consent was obtained. The area was cleaned with chlorhexidine. 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was used to make a wheal on the skin at the apex of the cyst. A 16 gauge needle was introduced into the cyst at the apex and thick clear fluid was aspirated into a syringe. The needle was removed. Gentle pressure was applied around the cyst to extract the remaining fluid. The wound was dressed with gauze, antibiotic ointment, and Coban.
    
TREATMENT:
Option 1: Watch and Wait
-(volar cyst) Allen test shows adequate perfusion through the radial artery
-The patient was told that 50% of ganglion cysts resolve, usually within 1 year
-Patient is agreeable to watch and wait

Option 2: Aspiration
-Cyst aspirated as above, the patient was warned that ganglion cysts often recur
-Patient to watch for signs of infection and return to clinic if these signs occur
    -fever
    -redness
    -swelling
    -pus
    -warmth
    -worsening pain
-No bathing x 2 weeks or until wound is fully healed

Option 3: Surgery (usually for recurrent ganglion cysts)
-Patient desires surgical management for recurrent ganglion cyst, referral placed

<p>Note: If the allen test shows poor perfusion, watch and wait is not a good idea.</p>
