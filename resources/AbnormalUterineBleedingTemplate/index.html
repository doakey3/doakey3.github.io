Bleeding Description:
Quantity: [AMOUNT, Note: > 80 mL = heavy, but quantity can be given as number of tampons/pads too]
Blood Clots: [YES/NO]
Postcoital Bleeding: [YES/NO, may indicate cervicitis, cervical ectropion, or cervical cancer]
Abdominopelvic pain: [YES/NO, may indicate infection, structural abnormality, or endometriosis]

OK to Skip Pelvic Exam for Adolescents If ALL are true:
(    ) Not sexually active
(    ) No trauma or infection suspected
(    ) Response to Initial treatment is adequate

Major Risk Factors for Endometrial Cancer (Definitely get endometrial biopsy if the following are true):
(    ) Age &gt;= 45
(    ) Long term use of unopposed estrogen
(    ) Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome)
(    ) Estrogen-producing tumor
(    ) Failed medical management

Minor Risk Factors for Endometrial Cancer (Consider getting endometrial biopsy of the following are true):
(    ) Obesity
(    ) Nulliparity
(    ) Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
(    ) History of infertility
(    ) Late menopause
(    ) Tamoxifen use
(    ) Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, gallbladder disease, or thyroid disease

Increased Risk of Bleeding Disorder: (consider workup for coagulopathy; present in ~20% of women w/menorrhagia)
(    ) Family history of bleeding disorder
(    ) Heavy menstrual bleeding since menarche
(    ) History of postpartum hemorrhage (1 L blood loss within 24 hours of delivery)
(    ) Heavy bleeding during surgery or dental procedures
(    ) Two or more of the following:
    (    ) Frequent gum bleeding
    (    ) Bruising of > 5 cm at least monthly
    (    ) Family history of abnormal bleeding

PLAN:
-pregnancy test
-CBC
-Thyroid function test
-prolactin (if oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea)
-pap smear (if not up to date)
-pelvic exam
-pelvic ultrasound

Pharmacologic Options for Chronic Bleeding: (Choose 1 of the following at a time)
-mirena (71-95% reduction in bleeding)
-continuous oral medroxyprogesterone (87% bleeding reduction) 5-20 mg per day in 1-3 divided doses
    -adjust dosea t 1-3 month intervals
    -does NOT prevent pregnancy
    -may cause hot flashes and weight gain (36% adn 38% risk respectively)
    -may help with endometriosis and fibroids
-cyclical oral medroxyprogesterone 5-20 mg per day on days 5 to 26 of menstrual cycle
    -bleeding will be triggered in the absence of the drug, good for regulating cycle
    -reduces bleeding overall, but not as much as continuous therapy
    -may cause weight gain
-any combined oral contraceptive (reduces bleeding by 35-69%, but only Natazia is FDA approved for this = estradiol valerate 3 mg/dienogest 2 mg)
-tranexamic acid 1.3 g by mouth daily for up to 5 days monthly during menstrual period (26-54% reduction, safe to use when trying to conceive)
    -not to be used in patients with increased risk of thrombosis
-Naproxen 500 mg by mouth twice daily during menstruation (10-52% reduction in bleeding)
    -avoid in patients with a bleeding disorder
