Health Problems Treatable with Combined Oral Contraceptives: (X = patient has this problem)
(    ) Dysmenorrhea
(    ) Endometriosis
(    ) Menorrhagia (COC's will not decrease fibroid size)
(    ) Premenstrual syndrome
(    ) Menstrual migraine (no aura)

Counseling points:
- Breast tenderness, nausea, and bloating are common when starting a combined oral contraceptive. These symptoms typically resolve quickly.
- Unscheduled bleeding may occur when starting a combined oral contraceptive. This typically resolves within 3 months
- Combined oral contraceptives may impact mood and sexual function
- There is no evidence that combined oral contraceptives cause weight gain
- Birth control pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections. Condom use is still recommended to prevent the spread of STI's.
- If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as it is noticed
- If you miss 2 or more doses: use the remaining pills at the usual time AND a backup form of contraception for 7 days
    - if missed 2 or more doses during the first week of the cycle and had unprotected sex, emergency contraception should be used within 72 hours of intercourse
    - if missed 2 or more doses during the last week of the cycle, finish out week 3's pills, then skip week 4 and move on to a new pill pack
- If you accidentally take 2 pills in one day by mistake, continue taking one pill daily without skipping (you'll finish the pack one day early, but that's ok)
- Almost all women will have a return of normal menses and fertility by 90 days after stopping combined oral contraceptives

<p>Guidelines: Where possible, use a monophasic pill with the 24/4 pattern (24 treatment days, 4 placebo).</p>
<p>Aura: sensory disturbance that may include flashes of light, blind spots, and tingling in hands or face that precede a migraine headache.</p>
<p>(Note, for this table, the full list of treatment options is huge. I just focused on what I would try first in a patient.)</p>

        <td>Mirena is the best (71 to 95% reduction in bleeding). oral Medroxyprogesterone (Provera) can reduce bleeding by 87%, but the oral form does not prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone can be used off-label to treat acute vaginal bleeding (20 mg PO TID x 7 days). A combined oral contraceptive will only reduce bleeding by 35-69% and there is only 1 FDA approved med and it is not in the military formulary.
