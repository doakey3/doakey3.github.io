General Plan Ideas:
- ibuprofen 400 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain
- acetaminophen 650 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain
- use a knee compression sleeve, especially while exercising
- rest, ice, elevation
- home physical therapy, patient to google "Rx3 physical therapy"
- physical therapy referral for strengthening and improvement of range of motion
- sports medicine referral, consider joint space injection
- general surgery referral, discuss bariatric surgery for patient with chronic knee pain and BMI >= 35
- follow up in 1 month if symptoms fail to resolve or earlier if symptoms worsen

------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNEE INJECTION, LIDOCAINE + KENALOG, PROCEDURE:
Procedure Name: Knee injection with lidocaine + Kenalog
Indication: Chronic knee pain, likely confounded or caused by osteoarthritis

Consent: The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient: acute and chronic pain, infection (minimized by sterile technique), bleeding (internal and external), and need for subsequent procedure to correct a complication or further treat symptoms. Rarely, damage to internal structures may occur requiring subsequent procedures or, exceedingly rare, loss of function of the joint. Benefits may include symptom relief and potentially diagnosis. The alternatives were explained to the patient including: not doing procedure or postponing the procedure. The disadvantages to not doing the procedure were discussed with the patent, including the persistence symptoms. The written consent form has been signed and placed in the patient’s medical record. The patient voiced understanding of the procedure and agreed to proceed.

Procedure Description: A timeout was completed before the start of the procedure - the site was verified and documented in the chart. Patient’s [LEFT/RIGHT] knee was prepped with chloraprep solution. Using a 25 gauge 1.5" needle, 1 mL of lidocaine 1% without epinephrine and 2 mL of Kenalog (40 mg/mL) was injected into the subpatellar joint space using the [MEDIAL/LATERAL] patella approach, without resistance. A dressing was then applied to the skin.

EBL: minimal

Return Precautions:
- fever
- swelling
- increasing pain
- difficulty walking

Expect mild soreness for 24-48 hours.

Followup in clinic in 1 month

KNEE INJECTION, HYALURONIC ACID
Procedure Name: Knee injection, hyaluronic acid (Hyalgan)
Indication: Chronic knee pain, likely confounded or caused by osteoarthritis

Consent: The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient: acute and chronic pain, infection (minimized by sterile technique), bleeding (internal and external), and need for subsequent procedure to correct a complication or further treat symptoms. Rarely, damage to internal structures may occur requiring subsequent procedures or, exceedingly rare, loss of function of the joint. Benefits may include symptom relief. The alternatives were explained to the patient including: not doing procedure or postponing the procedure. The disadvantages to not doing the procedure were discussed with the patent, including the persistence of symptoms. The written consent form has been signed and placed in the patient’s medical record. The patient voiced understanding of the procedure and agreed to proceed.

Description of Procedure: A timeout was completed before the start of the procedure - the site was verified and documented in the chart. Patient’s [LEFT/RIGHT] knee was prepped with chloraprep solution. Using a 20 gauge 1.5" needle, 1 full syringe of Hyalgan was injected into the subpatellar joint space using the [PROXIMAL/LATERAL] patella approach, without resistance. A dressing was then applied to the skin. 

EBL: minimal

Return Precautions:
- fever
- swelling
- increasing pain
- difficulty walking

Expect mild soreness for 24-48 hours.
