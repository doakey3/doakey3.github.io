Asthma Control Test Score: [score, note: a score of 19 or less indicates poor control]    
Number of ER visits in the last year for asthma: [NUMBER]
Peak flow personal best: [Best score]
Frequency of rescue inhaler use: [RESCUE INHALER USE]

ASTHMA SEVERITY RATING (The symptom with the greatest severity sets the rating)
Intermittent:
(    ) Daytime asthma symptoms occurring &lt;= 2 days per week
(    ) Two or fewer nocturnal awakenings per month
(    ) Use of short-acting beta agonists to relieve symptoms &lt;= 2 days per week
(    ) No interference with normal activities between exacerbations
(    ) FEV1 measurements between exacerbations are consistently within the normal range (&gt;= 80% predicted)
(    ) FEV1/FVC ratio between exacerbations that is age-adjusted normal
(    ) One or no exacerbations requiring oral glucocorticoids per year

Mild Persistent:
(    ) Symptoms more than twice weekly, but &lt; daily
(    ) Approximately three to four nocturnal awakenings per month due to asthma, but &lt; every week
(    ) Use of SABAs to relieve symptoms more than 2 days out of the week, but not daily
(    ) Minor interference with normal activities
(    ) FEV1 measuremnets within normal range (&gt;= 80 percent of predicted)

Moderate Persistent:
(    ) Daily symptoms of asthma
(    ) Nocturnal awakenings as often as once per week
(    ) Daily need for SABAs for symptom relief
(    ) Some limitation in normal activity
(    ) FEV1 &gt;= 60% &lt; 80% of predicted and FEV1/FVC below normal

Severe Persistent:
(    ) Symptoms thoughout the day
(    ) Nocturnal awakening due to asthma nightly
(    ) Reliever medication needed for symptoms several times daily
(    ) Activity limitation due to asthma

TREATMENT FOR ALL STAGES:
- trigger avoidance, consider possible triggers that only occur at school or workplace
    - dust mites, wash linens weekly, avoid down fillings, limit stuffed animals to those that can be washed, keep humidity to 30-50%
    - cockroach excrement, remove food sources (sweep floors, seal food containers)
    - animal hair--especially cat hair, keep pets outside if they trigger asthma. At the very least keep them out of the bedroom
    - mold, remove sources of moisture
    - other triggers may be possible including cold air, stress/anxiety, cigarette smoke, aspirin &amp; NSAIDs, exercise
- consider referral to allergist for allergen-specific IgE blood testing or skin testing to confirm allergic sensitivity
- use a peak flow meter and keep track of levels in the morning and evening
- patient to follow up monthly until symptoms are stable and well-controlled
- asthma action plan discussed

GOALS OF THERAPY:
- no more than twice weekly daytime symptoms
- no more than 2 episodes of nighttime wakening per month due to asthma
- requiring SABA no more than 2 times weekly except for exercise pre-treatments
- no interference with normal activities
- maintenance of normal peak expiratory flow
