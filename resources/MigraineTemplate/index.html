SNNOOP10 Headache Red Flags: (may indicate vascular, mass, or metabolic disturbance)
(    ) Systemic symptoms (e.g. fever) (consider giant cell arteritis, meningitis, encephalitis)
(    ) Neoplasm history
(    ) Neurologic deficit (e.g. decreased consciousness) (indicates hemorrhagic stroke)
(    ) Onset is sudden (e.g. thunderclap) (indicates possible subarachnoid hemorrhage)
(    ) Older age (onset after age 50) (indicates possible brain neoplasm)
(    ) Pattern change or recent onset of new headache
(    ) Positional headache (worse with standing, relieved with lying down) (indicates possible intracranial hemorrhage)
(    ) Precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise (indicates possible arnold-chiari malformation)
(    ) Papilledema (indicates increased intracranial pressure, possibly due to mass)
(    ) Progressive headache and atypical presentations
(    ) Pregnancy or puerperium (consider postpartum preeclampsia)
(    ) Painful eye with autonomic presentations
(    ) Post-traumatic onset of headache (intracranial hemorrhage?)
(    ) Pathology of immune system (e.g. HIV) (toxoplasmosis or other opportunistic illness)
(    ) Painkiller overuse or onset with new drug

Migraine Diagnostic Criteria:
(    ) At least 5 headaches that have symptoms of migraines
(    ) Headache duration of 4 to 72 hours

    Symptoms of Migraines (must have at least 2):
    (    ) Unilateral
    (    ) Pulsating
    (    ) Disabling
    (    ) Worse with exertion
    
    Other symptoms (must have at least 1):
    (    ) Nausea or vomiting
    (    ) Photophobia/Phonophobia

Aura (Reversible, no motor weakness, symptom lasts &gt; 5 mins &amp; &lt; 60 mins):
(    ) 2 headaches with aura symptoms

    Aura symptoms (must have at least 1):
    (    ) Visual (e.g. flickering spots/lines, or loss of vision)
    (    ) Sensory (e.g. numbness, paresthesias)
    (    ) Dysphasic speech
    
    Aura timing and location (must have at least 2):
    (    ) Symptom spreads gradually over 5 minutes
    (    ) Two or more symptoms occur in succession
    (    ) At least one symptom is unilateral
    (    ) Aura is accompanied or followed within 60 minutes by a headache

Indications for Prophylactic Therapy:
(    ) &gt;= 4 headaches per month
(    ) &gt;= 8 headache days per month
(    ) Debilitating attacks despite acute therapy
(    ) Overuse of acute medications
(    ) Patient preference for fewer attacks

TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR EVERYONE:
- keep a headache diary to identify headache triggers, common triggers include:
    - alcohol
    - artificial sweeteners (e.g. aspartame)
    - caffeine (overconsumption or withdrawal)
    - delayed or missed meals
    - exercise
    - foods (e.g. chocolate, soft cheese)
    - light
    - menses
    - odors (e.g. perfumes)
    - oral contraceptives
    - psychiatric comorbidities (e.g. anxiety, stress)
    - red wine
    - sleep disturbance (obstructive sleep apnea)
    - smoke
    - weather changes

ABORTIVE THERAPIES:

TREATMENT OPTION 1: Tylenol + Ibuprofen for mild-moderate migraine
- acetaminophen 1000 mg by mouth at the first sign of headache, may repeat Q6H PRN for headache
- ibuprofen 400 mg by mouth at the first sign of headache, may repeat Q6H PRN for headache
- reevaluate effectiveness after 3 headaches

TREATMENT OPTION 2: Sumatriptan
- sumatriptan 50 mg by mouth at the first sign of headache, may repeat dose after 2 hours; limit use to &lt; 10 days per month
- evaluate effect of medication after 3 headaches, may increase dose to 100 mg

PROPHYLACTIC THERAPIES:

Supplements:
-Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) 400 mg by mouth daily for at least 3 months --> about 50% reduction in frequency for many people
-CoQ10 100 mg by mouth three times daily for at least 3 months --> about 50% reduction in frequency for some people
-Butterbur 75 mg by mouth twice daily may be helpful
-Magnesium 400 mg by mouth daily may be helpful

"Migravent" may be a good option as this combines supplements into a single pill



TREATMENT OPTION 1: Topamax
- check renal function panel (creatinine)
- topamax 25 mg by mouth daily
    - avoid use in patients with increased intraocular pressure
    - avoid use in patients with history of anorexia nervosa/overexercising
    - patient should not operate heavy machinery until the effect of the medication is known
- titrate dose, increasing by 25 mg every week or every 3 headaches (whichever is longer) up to 100 mg daily

TREATMENT OPTION 2: Propranolol
- propranolol ER 40 mg by mouth daily
- slowly increase dose as needed, up to 160 mg daily
- continue medication for 3 months before deeming treatment a failure

TREATMENT OPTION 3: Depakote
- check CMP to evaluate for liver dysfunction
- check CBC
- check PT/PTT
- valproic acid ER 500 mg by mouth daily
- refer to neurology for long-term management of neurology
