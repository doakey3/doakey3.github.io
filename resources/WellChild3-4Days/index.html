Weight loss less than 10% of birth weight. Feeding every 2-3 hrs. Infant is having at least 1 wet diaper per day of age per day (normal frequency after 6 days is 6-8 per day).

<div id="notes">
<p>If not getting enough breastmilk, increase frequency of feeds to 10 times in 24 hrs and pump after breastfeeding, giving any extracted milk to the baby at the next feed.</p>

<p>If mother does not want to give vitamin D to baby (recommended), an alternative is for the mother to take 6000 IU daily of Vit D while breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Vegan mothers who don't use B12 supplements should give Vit B12 supplements to baby.</p>

<p>Weight loss of infants is most prominent in the first 3 days of life (while milk is coming in). Afterward, growth of at least 30 g per day is expected until 3 months of life.</p>
