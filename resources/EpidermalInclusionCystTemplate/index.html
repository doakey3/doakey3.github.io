PROCEDURE
A total of 4 cc's of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected around the base of the cyst. The area was cleaned with chlorhexidine and draped in a sterile fashion. An eliptical opening was made at the apex of the cyst. The cyst and cyst wall were removed. The wound was closed using 4-0 non-absorbable suture. The patient was counseled to avoid bathing or swimming for the next 2 weeks and encouraged to return in 10 days for suture removal.

PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS:
- expect mild soreness for 1 day
- avoid taking a bath or going swimming until the wound has completely healed, showering is OK
- Return to the clinic or go to the ER if you develop fever, chills, worsening pain in the arm, or bleeding from the surgical site
