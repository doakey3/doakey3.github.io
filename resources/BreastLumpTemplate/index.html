(    ) A first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer
(    ) A combination of 2 or more first- or second-degree relatives with ovarian cancer, regardless of age at diagnosis
(    ) History of breast cancer in a male relative
(    ) Ashkenazi Jewish descent and any first-degree relative or 2 second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer

(    ) Oophorectomy before age 35 (0.3)
(    ) Aspirin more than once per week for the last 6 months or longer (0.79)

Plan: (Palpable breast mass under 40 years old)
- breast ultrasound

Plan: (Highly suspiscious nodule in under 40 year-old)
- diagnostic mammogram first
- ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration following mammogram

Plan: (Palpable breast mass in over 40 year old)
- diagnostic mammogram

Plan: (No palpable mass in over 40 year old)
- screening mammogram
- follow up in 6 weeks for repeat check

Plan: (Milky discharge)
- check TSH, prolactin, and pregnancy test

    <p><b>Note</b>: Uptodate says for patients 30-39 years old, you can do either mammogram or ultrasound as the initial study. I've chosen to treat them like I would the younger than 30 year olds.</p>
    <p>The best time to examine breasts is 7-9 days after onset of menses</p>
