EXAM:
Vas deferens palpated bilaterally. No unusual mass, hernia, significant varicocele or other abnormalities palpated that could potentially preclude completion of a successful vasectomy.

PROCEDURE:
A timeout was completed before the start of the procedure. 

Under sterile conditions, [1]% lidocaine without epinephrine was injected superficially into the scrotum to produce a 1-2 cm wheal at the desired incision site. The needle was then advanced through the wheal parallel to the vas deferens toward the external inguinal ring. After gentle aspiration, 2-5 cc of [1]% lidocaine without epinephrine was injected into the external spermatic fascia. A 1-2 cm opening was made into the scrotum using the no-scalpel technique. The vas deferens was elevated through the incision. The soft tissue was bluntly dissected with a fine cured hemostat. The vas deferens was transected and placed into a specimen jar for analysis. The superior and inferior ends of the vas deferens were cauterized. Fascial interposition [WAS/WAS NOT] performed. Hemostasis was achieved and the vas deferens was reduced back into the scrotum. The above procedure was repeated for the opposite vas deferens.

EBL: &lt; 2 cc

PLAN:
- no activity x 24 - 72 hours, up to urinate only
- applying ice to the scrotum for 15 minutes every 3 hours during the first 24 hours post-op
- no bathing/showering x 24 hours
- refrain from sexual activity--ejaculation, exercise, or lifting more than 15 lbs x 7 days
- gradually increase activity over the next 2-3 weeks
- ejaculate 20 x's over the next 2-3 months prior to semen analysis
- use another form of birth control until the semen analysis confirms absence sperm
- patient to follow up in clinic in 7 days for post-op evaluation
- specimen samples for pathology review were ordered, clinic tissue tracker updated
