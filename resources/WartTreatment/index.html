Risks Discussed:
-pain, usually a burning sensation with the initial freeze and again on thawing
-occasionally watery discharge from the lesion can occur 3-4 days after treatment
-hypopigmentation, especially in darker skinned individuals
-loss of hair follicles in the area of treatment
-subdermal bleeding
-damage to underlying structures, including nerves

After obtaining consent,

(For highly keratinized warts, especially plantar warts)
The lesion was paired down using a blade to removed excess keratinized skin prior to the procedure.

Liquid nitrogen was sprayed intermittently on the wart to maintain an ice ball extending up to 2 mm beyond the lesion borders for 10-20 seconds. This was repeated 3 times, allowing about 1 minute thaw time between cycles.

Post-procedure instructions:
-Complete healing may take 6-8 weeks, but results are usually excellent
-Patient to return in 2-3 weeks for repeat therapy

Cryo Treatment Count (Including today): [USUALLY 3-4 TREATMENTS IS ENOUGH]

<div id="notes">
<p>For benign lesions, a single freeze-thaw cycle is sufficient. Plantar warts have been shown to have faster resolution with 2 freeze-thaw cycles.</p>
<p>50% of warts resolve at 1 year.</p>
<p>Having a healthy immune system is important for preventing warts. 90% of renal transplant patients develop warts within 5 years.</p>
