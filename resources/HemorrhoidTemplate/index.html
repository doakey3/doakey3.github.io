Indications for Colonoscopy In a Patient with Hemorrhoid(s):
(    ) Anemia
(    ) Bleeding that is atypical of hemorrhoids (bleeds between bowel movements)
(    ) Change in bowel patterns (Ex: change in stool caliber)
(    ) History of colorectal polyps
(    ) Family history of inflammatory bowel disease
(    ) Colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative

Chronic. Established clinically. Hemorrhoid position is [9 o'clock]. The patient has no obvious indications for colonoscopy. Treatment goal is to alleviate hemorrhoid discomfort, prevent constipation, and ease the passage of stools.

- drink at least 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day
- avoid straining or lingering on the toilet
- exercise regularly (reduces constipation)
- avoid medications that cause constipation (antihistamines, opiates, antacids containing aluminum)
- avoid fatty foods and alcohol which can cause constipation
- start sitz baths, warm water soaks 15 minutes at a time, 3 times daily--relieves irritation and reduces spasm of anal sphincter muscles
- start psyllium fiber supplement 7 grams (2 tablespoons) twice daily, continue for 6 weeks
- start colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily for 6 weeks
- start pramoxine 1% rectal foam (topical anesthetic) applied to anal area as needed up to 5 times daily for itching and pain
- start zinc oxide 20% topical paste applied to anal area as needed to protect irritated skin, maintain cleanliness, and reduce inflammation
- start hydrocortisone 1% rectal cream, applied to anal area sparingly up to 2 times daily, limit use to 7 days, relieves itching &amp; pain and reduces size of hemorrhoids
- if moderate-severe hemorrhoid pain does not improve after 6 weeks of medical therapy, plan to refer to general surgery
- tap water enemas can be used in episodes of severe constipation, but current guidelines recommend against regular use
    -risk of bowel perforation, especially in elderly patients and when patients use too much force
    -risk of anal irritation (may damage hemorrhoids with insertion)
