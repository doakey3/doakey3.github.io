INSERTION PROCEDURE:
A timeout was completed before the start of the procedure. The site was

The Nexplanon introducer was placed in the appropriate location and inserted in the usual fashion. The wound was dressed with a Steri-strip, gauze, and Coban. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

- remove steri-strip(s) after 72 hours

------------------------------------------------------------------------

REMOVAL CONSENT:
Risks were discussed with the patient including: 
- mild bruising
- infection
- damage to surrounding tissue
- scarring
- loss of contraception

REMOVAL PROCEDURE:
A time out was performed prior to the procedure and the patient described what would be done in her own words. The proximal tip of the implant was located. The area was prepped with alcohol and about 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected subcutaneously into the area. The area was cleaned with chlorhexidine and draped in a sterile fashion. A a shallow 3 mm incision parallel to the implant was made at the distal tip of the implant. The proximal end was gently pushed to advance the distal end through the incision. A mosquito clamp was used to grasp the tip of the Nexplanon and it was gently removed from the patient's arm. The Nexplanon was measured to be 4 cm after removal. The edges of the incision were approximated with a Steri-strip and dressed with gauze and Coban.

PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS
- leave the pressure dressing on for 24 hours
- remove steri-strip(s) after 72 hours
- expect mild soreness for 1 day
- avoid taking a bath or going swimming until the wound has completely healed, showering is OK
- Return to the clinic or go to the ER if you develop fever, chills, worsening pain in the arm, or bleeding from the surgical site
