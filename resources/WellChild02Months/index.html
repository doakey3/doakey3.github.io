<p>Start iron supplementation at 2 weeks for premature infants and continue for 12-15 months.</p>

<p>Iron should be supplemented in breastfed infants and those who are receiving low-iron formulas. Depending on where you read, iron supplementation can begin as early as at 2 weeks even in healthy children. I usually start at 4 months of age.</p>

<p>If not getting enough breastmilk, increase frequency of feeds to 10 times in 24 hrs and pump after breastfeeding, giving any extracted milk to the baby at the next feed.</p>

<p>If mother does not want to give vitamin D to baby (recommended), an alternative is for the mother to take 6000 IU daily of Vit D while breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Vegan mothers who don't use B12 supplements should give Vit B12 supplements to baby.</p>

<p>Weight loss of infants is most prominent in the first 3 days of life (while milk is coming in). Afterward, growth of at least 30 g per day is expected until 3 months of life.</p>
