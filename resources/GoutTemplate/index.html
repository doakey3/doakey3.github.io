- plan to check uric acid level at monthly intervals until at goal
- start colchicine 0.6 mg by mouth daily until allopurinol dose is stable
- avoid grapefruit juice while using colchicine

ALLOPURINOL REGIMEN (RENAL DISEASE):
- start allopurinol at 1.5 * eGFR by mouth daily
    - stop drug immediately if a skin rash develops (may be a severe cutaneous adverse reaction)
    - plan to increase dose by 50 mg monthly until uric acid at goal, max dose = 800 mg daily
- start colchicine 0.6 mg by mouth daily until allopurinol dose is stable
