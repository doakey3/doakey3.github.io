(    ) Has not had sexual intercourse since the start of last normal menses
(    ) Has been consistently using a reliable form of contraception
(    ) Is &lt;= 7 days after spontaneous or induced abortion
(    ) Is within 4 weeks postpartum
(    ) Is fully or nearly fully breastfeeding, amenorrheic, and &lt; 6 months postpartum
    
Mirena Contraindications:
(    ) Pregnancy or suspicion of pregnancy (not for emergency contraception)
(    ) Uterine abnormality
(    ) History of pelvic inflammatory disease without intrauterine pregnancy since PID
(    ) Postpartum endometritis or infected abortion in the last 3 months
(    ) Known or suspected uterine or cervical neoplasia
(    ) Known or suspected breast cancer or other progestin-sensitive cancer
(    ) Uterine bleeding of unknown etiology
(    ) Untreated acute cervicitis or vaginitis or other lower genital tract infection
(    ) Acute liver disease or liver tumor even if benign
(    ) Increased susceptibility to pelvic infection
(    ) Previous IUD that has not been removed
(    ) Hypersensitivity to any component of Mirena

INSERTION CONSENT:
The following risks were discussed with the patient:
- pain, acute or chronic
- infection, risk minimized by sterile technique
- bleeding, especially during the first 3 months after placement
- need for surgery to correct a complication such as perforation

INSERTION PROCEDURE:
A timeout was completed before the start of the procedure. The site was verified and documented in the chart. The speculum was inserted and the cervix was identified. After cleansing, sounding (uterus sounded to [CENTIMETERS]) and applying a tenaculum to the anterior/superior cervix, an intrauterine device was inserted per the manufacturer's protocol. The string was cut to a 3 centimeters length and a sample of the remaining string was given to the patient for later comparison. The patient tolerated the procedure well, without any signs or symptoms of vasovagal responses. 

EBL: &lt; 5 mL
Chaperone: [CHAPERONE]
Lot#: [LOT NUMBER]
Exp: [EXPIRATION DATE OF IUD]

PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS
- expect mild soreness x 1 day
- use of condoms is recommended because a Mirena does not protect against sexually transmitted infections
- use a backup form of contraception (such as condoms) for 7 days after Mirena is placed
- COME BACK TO CLINIC IF:
- cannot feel IUD strings
- exposure to a sexually transmitted infection
- new onset severe migraine headaches
- severe vaginal bleeding
- fever and feeling ill

------------------------------------------------------------------------

REMOVAL PROCEDURE
A timeout was completed before the start of the procedure. The speculum was inserted and the cervix was identified. The IUD strings were identified and grasped with a Kelly clamp and the IUD was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. No complications.

EBL: &lt; 5 mL
Chaperone: [CHAPERONE]
